  <h2>Notable Players</h2>
  <h3>Nick Foles</h3>
  <p>The one and only Nick Foles is the named MVP of the Super Bowl LII. Foles<br/>
     is the first quarterback in 16 years to start the season as a backup and win<br/>
     the Super Bowl. After receiving the MVP honors, Foles states "There's plenty<br/>
     of kids watching this game right now dreaming about this moment, some day will<br/>
     be here, and to be here with my daughter, my wife and my family, my teammates,<br/>
     this city... we're very blessed." The primary reasons for his naming are because<br/>
     of his three touchdown passes, and his unforgettable touchdown catch.</p>

  <p>The success the team has with Foles and the run-pass play has been widely talked</br>
     about throughout the playoffs. Thanks to the Eagles' coach, Pederson, the quarterback</br>
     was able to benefit and this allowed the eagles to hold the lead during the game.</br>
     As said by ESPN, "They were big time plays made by a big time quarterback. A Super</br>
     Bowl champion and Super Bowl MVP. An underdog no more."</p>
